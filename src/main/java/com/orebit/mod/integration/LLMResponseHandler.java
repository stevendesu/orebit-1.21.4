/**
 * LLMResponseHandler.java
 *
 * Main Component: integration/
 * Environment: MAIN
 *
 * This class processes raw LLM responses received from the `LLMInterface`
 * and converts them into structured `InterpretedIntent` objects.
 * It handles JSON parsing, validation, and fallback logic to ensure that
 * even imperfect or ambiguous LLM output results in a usable and traceable
 * interpretation of the user’s goal. It acts as a decoder and safety layer
 * between the LLM's output and the bot's goal resolution system.
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * What This File Does:
 * ---------------------------
 * - Parses structured (typically JSON) output from the LLM
 * - Extracts:
 *     - A symbolic goal ID
 *     - Optional rationale or explanation
 *     - Follow-up prompts or clarification cues
 *     - Confidence scores or multiple candidates
 * - Converts these into a validated `InterpretedIntent`
 * - Logs issues or ambiguities for human review
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * How This File Differs:
 * ---------------------------
 * - Unlike `LLMInterface`, this class doesn't call the LLM—it processes its output
 * - Unlike `GoalDispatcher`, this class doesn't act on the intent—it builds it
 * - Unlike `CommandParser`, this class expects freeform or generative responses
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * Assumptions:
 * ---------------------------
 * - The LLM response follows a known, expected JSON schema
 * - Any missing or invalid fields can be safely defaulted or rejected
 * - Clarification data is optionally embedded in the response itself
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * Dependencies:
 * ---------------------------
 * - `InterpretedIntent`: The structured result created from parsing
 * - `LLMInterface`: The source of the raw LLM response
 * - JSON parsing utility (e.g., Gson, Jackson, or built-in)
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * Dependents:
 * ---------------------------
 * - `LLMInterface`: Calls this after receiving a response
 * - `GoalDispatcher`: Consumes the resulting `InterpretedIntent`
 * - `Debug tools`: May log parsed or rejected intents for analysis
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * Implementation Details:
 * ---------------------------
 * - Should validate all fields before building an intent object
 * - May fallback to a default or no-op intent if parsing fails
 * - Logs raw response and intent object for audit or debugging
 * - Could support versioned schemas if LLM output evolves over time
