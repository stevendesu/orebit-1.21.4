/**
 * PathSmoother.java
 *
 * Main Component: pathfinding/
 * Environment: MAIN
 *
 * This class performs post-processing on a raw `BlockPathPlan` to reduce
 * redundancy, simplify sequences of similar operations, and improve memory
 * efficiency. It does not change the logical result of the plan—it simply
 * restructures it to be more compact and easier to process or store.
 *
 * The most common smoothing action is collapsing consecutive operations of
 * the same type (e.g., multiple `WalkOperation`s in the same direction) into
 * a single multi-step operation or aggregated representation. The result is a
 * cleaner, smaller, and potentially faster-to-execute path.
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * What This File Does:
 * ---------------------------
 * - Collapses sequences of identical or aligned operations
 * - Reduces plan size and improves processing performance
 * - Can optionally discard low-impact operations (e.g., short detours)
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * How This File Differs from Others:
 * ---------------------------
 * - Unlike `BlockPathfinder`, this does not compute new paths—it compresses them
 * - Unlike `PathPlan`, this modifies structure—not semantics
 * - Unlike `PathFollower`, this does not execute the plan—it prepares it
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * Assumptions:
 * ---------------------------
 * - The input path is complete and valid
 * - Operations have stable equality or merge semantics (e.g., "walk east 3 blocks")
 * - World conditions remain consistent during smoothing
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * Dependencies:
 * ---------------------------
 * - `BlockPathPlan`: The plan to be optimized
 * - `BlockPathOperation`: May require inspection or combining of operations
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * Dependents:
 * ---------------------------
 * - `PathReplanner`: May run this before returning a new plan
 * - `PathCache`: May store only smoothed versions of paths
 * - `Debug tools`: May show before/after smoothing results
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * Implementation Details:
 * ---------------------------
 * - Can apply greedy merging (e.g., forward scan and collapse)
 * - May discard operations with negligible cost or length
 * - Should preserve operation ordering and final destination
 * - Could support optional strategies:
 *     - Light smoothing (combine movement only)
 *     - Aggressive smoothing (remove redundant ops)
