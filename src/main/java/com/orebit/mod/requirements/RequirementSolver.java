/**
 * RequirementSolver.java
 *
 * Main Component: requirements/
 * Environment: MAIN
 *
 * This abstract class defines the interface for transforming a `Requirement`
 * into one or more possible `Satisfier` instances—each representing a valid
 * plan for fulfilling the given requirement under current world and bot
 * conditions.
 *
 * A `RequirementSolver` encapsulates the decision logic for resolving complex
 * or ambiguous goals into concrete task paths. It may factor in context such as
 * the bot's behavior profile, current inventory, nearby structures, past memory,
 * or environmental constraints.
 *
 * This allows different bots—or even the same bot under different states—to
 * resolve the same requirement in different ways. For example, a `Requirement`
 * to "obtain iron" could be satisfied by mining, trading, looting a chest, or
 * constructing a golem farm depending on the available resources and preferences.
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * What This File Does:
 * ---------------------------
 * - Defines a pluggable strategy for resolving a `Requirement`
 * - Produces one or more `Satisfier` objects representing task paths
 * - Enables behavior-based or situational planning
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * How This File Differs from Others:
 * ---------------------------
 * - Unlike `Requirement`, this is behavior logic—not a data structure
 * - Unlike `Satisfier`, this produces plans—it doesn’t represent one
 * - Unlike `TaskExecutor`, this is planning-time logic—not execution
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * Assumptions:
 * ---------------------------
 * - A single requirement may yield zero, one, or many satisfiers
 * - Solver logic may change based on bot profile or context
 * - Solvers should be stateless and reusable
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * Dependencies:
 * ---------------------------
 * - `Requirement`: Input goal condition to be resolved
 * - `Satisfier`: Output mini-task plan(s) that fulfill the requirement
 * - `WorldContext`, `BehaviorProfile`, or `PathCostEstimator`: Optional context helpers
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * Dependents:
 * ---------------------------
 * - `Requirement`: May delegate to a solver if not self-resolving
 * - `TaskPlanner`, `AIStateMachine`: Use solvers to generate actionable plans
 * - `BehaviorManager`: May provide solver preferences based on bot profiles
 *
 * ---------------------------
 * Implementation Details:
 * ---------------------------
 * - Method signature example:
 *     - `List<Satisfier> resolve(Requirement requirement, PlanningContext context)`
 * - May include default or specialized solvers:
 *     - `GreedyResourceSolver`
 *     - `CraftingOnlySolver`
 *     - `ExplorationWeightedSolver`
 *     - `FastestPathSolver`
