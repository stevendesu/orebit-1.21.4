## Prerequisites

Orebit is a mod for MineCraft **1.21.4**. It is not compatible with any older
or newer versions of the game. I may update it to 1.21.5 in the future, but for
now this is what you get.

Orebit is a Fabric mod, so you will need to install Fabric and Fabric API. You
can find instructions for that [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/player:setup).

## Installing Orebit

Download the latest version of Orebit from the
[releases page](https://github.com/stevendesu/orebit-1.21.4/releases). Then
extract the contents of the zip file into your `mods` folder. To find your
`mods` folder:

 * On Windows, it is located at `%AppData%/.minecraft/mods`
 * On Mac, it is located at `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods`
 * On Linux, it is located at `~/.minecraft/mods`
